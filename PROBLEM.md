## Problem Statement: Interface with default methods

This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique.

  - Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
  - Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
  - Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass 
  - Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

        Room is an Interface having default methods, AbstractRoom is an abstract class of type Room, Square and Rectangle class inherit AbstractRoom
        
        Square class toString() format for sample data
            Square [colour=brown, side=10]
        	
        Rectangle class toString() format for sample data
            Rectangle [colour=brown, length=10, breadth=20]
            
## Instructions
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
- Follow best practices while coding
